        In 2008 Tim was highly commended in the Furniture category of The Wood Awards for this beautiful cope chest which now graces Tewkesbury Abbey.

        This prestigious award is given by the Worshipful Company of Carpenters and recognises excellence in wood design.

        Judges comprise high profile architects, engineers, furniture designer / makers, wood specialists and leading architectural journalists.

        The judges commented:

        **_"A beautifully crafted piece which is one of few modern examples of this traditional means of storage"_**

         The design comprises five quadrant shaped drawers which turn round a corner pivot. The top drawer is covered with glass protected with timber leaves. The latter can be opened so the top drawer can be used for exhibition purposes. The drawers are so designed that when each is opened it pulls with it the next drawer below as a means of support.

        Oak was chosen partly because of its durability and longevity, and partly because of its being able to take the degree and precision of detail required. Oak is also the timber which has overwhelmingly been used for furnishings and fittings in the Abbey in the past.
