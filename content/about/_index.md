      Tim, the son of a vicar, has been involved with the church all his life. He studied engineering at Portsmouth Polytechnic and then worked in pattern and mould making. These skills, along with top quality joinery, are evident in the precision and beauty of all pieces from TDJ Joinery.

      Examples from TDJ Joinery's Prinknash workshop can be seen throughout the country, including major commissions from Tewkesbury Abbey, Leeds Pastoral Centre and St. Matthew's Northampton, a church famed for it's support of the arts and now able to boast craft from Henry Moore, Graham Sutherland and Tim Jeffree.
